# Missing Files That Need to Be Created

The following React component files are missing and need to be created:

1. `client/src/components/CharacterCreation.tsx`
2. `client/src/components/CharacterCreation.css`
3. `client/src/components/GameInterface.tsx`
4. `client/src/components/GameInterface.css`
5. `client/src/components/ComicPanel.tsx` (optional, for Phase 2)
6. `client/src/components/ComicPanel.css` (optional, for Phase 2)

These files were deleted and need to be recreated. The server files have been created, but the client components are missing.
